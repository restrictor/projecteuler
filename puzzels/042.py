""" Coded triangle numbers

    Problem 42
    The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, t_n = Â½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:

    1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

    By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding
    these values we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t_10.
    If the word value is a triangle number than we shall call the word a triangle word.

    Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand
    common English words, how many are triangle words?
